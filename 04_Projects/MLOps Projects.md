### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Set up Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
- Track model metrics, drift detection.
- Timeline: Month_08

### 5. Orchestration
- Full automated pipeline using Kubeflow or Airflow.
- Retraining triggers based on drift detection.
- Timeline: Month_09-12

### 6. Advanced MLOps
- Cloud-native multi-region deployment.
