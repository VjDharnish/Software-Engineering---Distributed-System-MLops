## Goals
- Distributed Systems: consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos)
- Implement leader election demo
- MLOps: batch data pipelines, feature stores (Feast)
- Build small ML project with versioned data

## Deliverables
- Raft leader election simulation
- Data pipeline using Airflow or Prefect
- ML project with tracked experiments
